4: What happens when you intialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

You orginally created the new repository by the command git init. After
initializing a repostitory you should examine it by the command git status. This
allows you to see no commits have been made and the files the repository hasn't
begun tracking.

7: How is the stafing area different from the working directory and the
repsitory?What value do you think this offers?

Staging area is different from the working directory and the repository, because
it holds changes you've made to documents without yet making a committs, you can
also group documents together and commit them as one. This may be valued because
it is more efficient and allows for mistakes to be easily fixed.
